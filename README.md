# ASPICE
Automotive SPICE – Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination.\
To Assess the performance and help with evaluating software development processes of OEM suppliers in the Automotive industry.\
Defines best practices and processes for automotive software development that are not necessarily related to safety.\
Evaluate if an organisation meets a specific level of quality and certain safety and performance standards.\
Focuses on continuous process improvement to raise the supplier’s capability level.\
ASPICE was developed within the ISO/IEC 15504 standard – SPICE.\
The Verification and Validation model - a V-model, is what Automotive SPICE builds on.

# ISO 26262 
ISO 26262 is the international standard for the __functional safety__ of electrical and electronic systems in road vehicles.\
Defines guidelines to minimize the risk of accidents and ensure that automotive components perform their intended functions correctly and at the right time.\
Goal is to cover all functional safety aspects of the development process.\
Safety is the main focus of ISO 26262.\
It outlines a risk classification system (Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or ASILs).\
Aims to reduce possible hazards caused by the malfunctioning behaviour of electrical and electronic (E/E) systems.

# ASIL
ASIL refers to Automotive Safety Integrity Level.\
It is a risk classification system defined by the ISO 26262 standard.\
4 ASILs identified by the standard: ASIL A, ASIL B, ASIL C, ASIL D. ASIL D dictates the highest integrity requirements on the product and ASIL A the lowest.\
Hazards that are identified as QM (Quality Mangment) do not dictate any safety requirements.\
ASILs are established by performing hazard analysis and risk assessment.\
``` ASIL = Severity × ( Exposure × Controllability ) ```\
For each electronic component in a vehicle, engineers measure three specific variables.
1. Severity (the type of injuries to the driver and passengers)
2. Exposure (how often the vehicle is exposed to the hazard)
3. Controllability (how much the driver can do to prevent the injury)
